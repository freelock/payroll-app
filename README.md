# payroll-app - DEPRECATED!

This version is built in Vue2, which is EOL, and with vulnerable SSL libraries. Replacing with new Vue3 port in progress.

Current version is not deployed -- this needs to be run locally for the time being.

A payroll calculation app. Currently has 2024 US federal taxes, and Washington State deductions. Deductions must be manually edited in store.js, and there is no facility for saving data -- at the moment this is a proof-of-concept.
